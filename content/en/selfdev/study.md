<div class="text-justify">
I strengthen my skills by learning new technologies through online courses and immediately applying them to personal projects.  
Rather than staying at the theoretical level, I practice implementation in real development environments such as **FastAPI, Vue, and Python**,  
enhancing my problem-solving abilities.

In addition, by continuously practicing code quality improvement and version control using GitHub,  
I am developing **professional-level development habits**.  
Through this process, I am building an integrated understanding of not only technology but also **project design, debugging, and deployment**.
