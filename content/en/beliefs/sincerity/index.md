## 💖 Sincerity

I believe the most important quality in any work is **genuine sincerity**.  
Even if the result isn’t perfect, I trust that consistency and integrity throughout the process build greater trust in the end.

When working with any technology,  
I evaluate myself not by “how fast I finish,” but by “how deeply I understand.”
