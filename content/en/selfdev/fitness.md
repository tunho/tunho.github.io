<div class="text-justify">
I maintain **focus, physical strength, and consistent self-discipline** by working out at a fitness center at least three times a week,  
combining weight training with cardio exercises.

Regular exercise goes beyond building physical strength â€” it plays a major role in maintaining mental balance  
throughout study and development processes.  
A strong body supports a steady mind; each workout helps me reflect on the day and recharge energy for the next goal.

This routine provides a solid foundation for **sustainable concentration and resilience**,  
especially when tackling long-term projects or research tasks.
