        Hello! Iâ€™m **Junho Lee**, an undergraduate student in the **Department of Computer & Artificial Intelligence** at **Jeonbuk National University (JBNU)**.  
        I am currently conducting research at **MacsLAB (Medical AI Laboratory)**, focusing on **medical image analysis** and **deep learning model development**.  
        My main interests include **improving AI model accuracy**, **automating medical data preprocessing**, and **developing web-based medical image viewers**.

        I primarily work with **PyTorch** for modeling and **FastAPI + Vue3 (TypeScript)** for full-stack development.  
        To make AI models deployable in real clinical environments,  
        I design and implement the **entire pipeline**â€”from backend to frontend to AI model integrationâ€”myself.

        Balancing research and development, I aim not only to enhance performance but also to design **practically usable systems**.  
        In particular, I focus on **improving DICOM viewer UX/UI**, **AI result visualization**, and **interactive measurement tools**,  
        developing interfaces that can be applied directly in medical practice.

        ### ðŸ”¬ Main Research & Projects
        - **DICOM Viewer Development:** Displays medical images (CT, X-ray, etc.) with distance, angle, and area measurement tools and window-level adjustment functions  
        - **AFF (Atypical Femoral Fracture) Detection Model:** Built PyTorch-based CNN model and Grad-CAM visualization pipeline  
        - **Medical Image Analysis Web Platform:** Integrated FastAPI backend and Vue3 frontend, deployed on the cloud  
        - **MNIST Classification Model:** Trained MLP model for handwritten digit (0â€“9) recognition and developed a visualization dashboard  
        - **Automatic DICOM Metadata Parsing & Pixel Scaling:** Implemented precise measurements using actual physical units (mm/px)

        ---

        ### ðŸ§­ Future Goals
        - Enhance **explainability** of AI models through visualization research  
        - Commercialize and optimize **web-based diagnostic assistance systems** for medical imaging  
        - Build a **general-purpose medical imaging platform** applicable to various medical datasets
