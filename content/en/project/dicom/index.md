## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **web-based platform for efficient visualization and analysis of medical imaging (DICOM) data**.  
To integrate AI diagnostic models from medical AI research into real clinical workflows,  
we implemented an **interface that allows simultaneous comparison and review of AI diagnostic results and original images**.

## Key Features

- ü©ª **DICOM Viewer**  
  Supports multi-frame (CT/MRI) images, zoom and pan functions, and window-level adjustments
- üìè **Distance Measurement Tool**  
  Enables precise millimeter-scale measurement using pixel spacing metadata
- ü§ñ **AI Prediction Visualization**  
  Displays predictions from PyTorch-based deep learning models as bounding box overlays
- üîÑ **Result Comparison Mode**  
  Switch between original and AI-analyzed images with a single button
- üåê **Web-Integrated System**  
  Built with FastAPI backend and Vue 3 frontend, enabling real-time data communication

## Project Significance

In medical imaging AI research, it is crucial not only to improve model accuracy  
but also to **develop tools that medical professionals can actually use**.  
This project goes beyond experimental AI development ‚Äî  
it is evolving into a **‚Äúbridge‚Äù system connecting medical research and clinical practice**.
