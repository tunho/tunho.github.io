## 🤝 Empathy

I believe AI and technology are ultimately **tools made for people**.  
Before writing any code, I always ask myself, “How will this feature affect the user’s experience?”

In lab projects and collaborations, I strive to think from others’ perspectives.  
Even small acts of empathy can greatly enhance both teamwork and project quality.
