<div class="text-justify">
I continuously grow by reading at least two technical or self-development books every month.  
Rather than simply reading, I organize key concepts and insights from each chapter in **Google Notes**,  
adding my own thoughts and experiences to reinterpret them in my own words.

Through this process, I expand not only my technical knowledge but also my perspective and problem-solving skills.  
This habit inspires me when starting new projects and provides a foundation for setting better development directions.
