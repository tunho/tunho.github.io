Hello! I‚Äôm **Junho Lee**, an undergraduate student in the **Department of Computer & Artificial Intelligence** at **Jeonbuk National University (JBNU)**.  
I am currently conducting research at **MacsLAB (Medical AI Laboratory)**, focusing on **medical image analysis** and **deep learning model development**.  
My main interests include **improving AI model accuracy**, **automating medical data preprocessing**, and **developing web-based medical image viewers**.

I primarily work with **PyTorch** for modeling and **FastAPI + Vue3 (TypeScript)** for full-stack development.  
To make AI models deployable in real clinical environments,  
I design and implement the **entire pipeline**‚Äîfrom backend to frontend to AI model integration‚Äîmyself.

Balancing research and development, I aim not only to enhance performance but also to design **practically usable systems**.  
In particular, I focus on **improving DICOM viewer UX/UI**, **AI result visualization**, and **interactive measurement tools**,  
developing interfaces that can be applied directly in medical practice.

## üî¨ Main Research & Projects

- **DICOM Viewer Development:** Displays medical images (CT, X-ray, etc.) with distance, angle, and area measurement tools and window-level adjustment functions
- **AFF (Atypical Femoral Fracture) Detection Model:** Built PyTorch-based CNN model and Grad-CAM visualization pipeline
- **Medical Image Analysis Web Platform:** Integrated FastAPI backend and Vue3 frontend, deployed on the cloud
- **MNIST Classification Model:** Trained MLP model for handwritten digit (0‚Äì9) recognition and developed a visualization dashboard
- **Automatic DICOM Metadata Parsing & Pixel Scaling:** Implemented precise measurements using actual physical units (mm/px)

## üß≠ Future Goals

- Enhance **explainability** of AI models through visualization research
- Commercialize and optimize **web-based diagnostic assistance systems** for medical imaging
- Build a **general-purpose medical imaging platform** applicable to various medical datasets
